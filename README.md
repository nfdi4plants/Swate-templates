# Swate Templates

A collection of minimal information standard templates for [Swate](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/docs/implementation/Swate.html).

The templates in this repository are crawled by [Swobup](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/Swobup) and written into the production Swate database.

Anyone can access them via the [template search](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/docs/SwateManual/Docs05-Templates.html) function.

:rocket: In addition, the templates are now automatically converted via a github-action upon every push into a [templates.json](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/Swate-templates/releases/download/latest/templates.json) file, which contains **all** templates.
Note, that this feature is not yet implemented into all associated tools (e.g. Swate, SwateDB). For details check "releases" on the right.
